## Which patients are at risk for functional decline after fusion surgery?

In medicine, we aim to do no harm. Non-home discharge may be an indicator not only that a patient's quality of life has not improved, but that they suffered functional decline following surgery requiring a higher level of care. In extreme cases, non-home discharge is due to a postoperative death. It can also indicate temporary or permanent loss of function or decline in health status.  

In order to predict which patients do not go home following surgery, we constructed a maximal model including 12 predictors deemed clinically important by two anesthesiologists who care for spinal fusion patients as well as a rehabilitation expert. Using literature and exploratory crosstab analysis we reduced the initial model to 3 predictors: age (in years), weight, and pre-existing hematologic disorder. 

Age and pre-existing hematologic disorder were identified as significant (a=0.01) predictors of non-routine discharge (any outcome that did not involve the patient returning to their prior home, which includes death in the hospital).

We concluded that for every one year increase in age the odds of non-routine discharge increased by (1/.83=1.2) by 20%.If the patient has a  pre-existing hematologic disorder the odds of being discharged to a health care facility are (1/.279=3.58) 3.58 the odds of being discharged to home.
