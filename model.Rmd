## Who gets discharged home after spinal fusion surgery?


We conducted a logistic regression analyis. The initial model included 12 predictors. Using literature and exploratory crosstab analysis we reduced the initial model to 3 predictors: age (in years), weight, and pre-existing hematologic disorder. Age and pre-existing hematologic disorder were significant (a=0.01)

We concluded that for every one year increase in age the odds of being released to a health care facility (not home) increased by (1/.83=1.2) by 20%.If the patient has a  pre-existing hematologic disorder the odds of being discharged to a health care facility are (1/.279=3.58) 3.58 the odds of being discharged to home.
