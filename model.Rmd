## Which patients are at risk for functional decline after fusion surgery?

In medicine, we aim to do no harm. Non-home discharge may be an indicator not only that a patient's quality of life has not improved, but that they suffered functional decline following surgery requiring a higher level of care. In extreme cases, non-home discharge is due to a postoperative death. It can also indicate temporary or permanent loss of function or decline in health status.  

In order to predict which patients do not go home following surgery, we constructed a maximal model including 11 predictors deemed clinically important by two anesthesiologists who care for spinal fusion patients as well as a rehabilitation expert. Using literature and exploratory crosstab analysis we reduced the initial model to 6 predictors: age, history of asthma, chronic lung disease, pre-existing hematologic disorder, need for nutritional support, and severity of scoliosis. 

Age and pre-existing hematologic disorder were identified as significant (alpha = 0.05) predictors of non-routine discharge (any outcome that did not involve the patient returning to their prior home, which includes death in the hospital).

We conclude that every advancing year of age decreases the odds of discharge to home by 18%. Similarly, a preoperative diagnosis of hematological disease decreases the odds of discharge to home by 73%. Other factors such as preoperative diagnosis of asthma, chronic lung disease, or need for nutritional supplementation may be predictive of non-home discharge, however larger studies are needed to confirm the magnitude of these effects.
