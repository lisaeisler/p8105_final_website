### Our project

This project utilizes data requested from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Pediatric Database [ACS NSQIP-P](https://www.facs.org/quality-programs/childrens-surgery/pediatric/program-specifics/quality-support-tools/puf).

Please find the full written report here [report](Report.html) and plots [dashboard](dashboard.html) created for my Data Science class.

Find our research group's code for these analyses on [github](https://github.com/lisaeisler/p8105_cpspine.git). If you'd like you can [email](ldl2113@cumc.columbia.edu) us with any questions.
