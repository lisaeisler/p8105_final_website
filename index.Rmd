### Introduction
Scoliosis is a curvature of the spine which impairs physical function and posture, contributes to pain, and in extreme cases stresses vital organs.

Patients with scoliosis may require surgical correction in a procedure called spinal fusion. The goal of this procedure is to use special instruments to join the vertebral bones so that the spine cannot bend, and to correct deformity. 

Scoliosis often occurs in children with cerebral palsy. At the time of surgery, many patients are already severely disabled due to their primary disease, and therefore restoring them to perfect physical functioning is not the end goal. In these cases, it is hoped that correcting the deformity will better enable them to sit upright, to be cared for by others, and to improve their quality of life.

We propose that patient selection for these procedures is crucial, given the risks of this highly invasive surgery in an already medically complex population. Therefore, we aim to develop a multiple regression model demonstrating preoperative characteristics associated with adverse 30-day outcomes (particularly discharge to a higher level of care), in hopes of identifying those in whom the risks do not outweight the benefits.

### Data Source
This project utilizes data requested from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Pediatric Database [ACS NSQIP-P](https://www.facs.org/quality-programs/childrens-surgery/pediatric/program-specifics/quality-support-tools/puf).
