This project utilizes data requested from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Pediatric Database [ACS NSQIP-P](https://www.facs.org/quality-programs/childrens-surgery/pediatric/program-specifics/quality-support-tools/puf).

Please find the full written report here [report](Report.html) and plots [dashboard](dashboard.html) created for my Data Science class.
